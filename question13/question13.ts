/*Your Own Array: Think of your favorite mode of transportation, such as a motorcycle or a car, and make a list that stores several examples. 
Use your list to print a series of statements about these items, such as â€œI would like to own a Honda motorcycle.*/


// Here is the list of favourite transportation
let favtransport: string[]= ["Honda", "Civics", "City", "Mehran"]

// Here we use "map" command for print series of statements
favtransport.map((items) => console.log(`I like to go on drive in ${items}`))
