/*Stripping Names: Store a personâ€™s name, and include some whitespace characters at the beginning and end of the name. 
 Make sure you use each character combination, "\t" and "\n", at least once. Print the name once, so the
  whitespace around the name is displayed. Then print whitespace around the name is displayed.*/
