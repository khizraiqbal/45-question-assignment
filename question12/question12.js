/*Greetings: Start with the array you used in Exercise 11, but instead of just printing each person’s name, print a message to them.
The text of each message should be the same, but each message should be personalized with the person’s name.*/
// Here we are using the same list of friends of Question 11
var friendnames = ["Ahmed:", "Areeb:", "Ahsan:", "Iqbal:"];
// Now here using printing message 
var message = "Hey! How are you?";
// For printing message each here we use + sign and here we are using (" ") <=this for spacing b/w name and message
console.log(friendnames[0] + " " + message);
console.log(friendnames[1] + " " + message);
console.log(friendnames[2] + " " + message);
console.log(friendnames[3] + " " + message);
